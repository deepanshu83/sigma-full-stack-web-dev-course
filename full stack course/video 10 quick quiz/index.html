        1. Gaming Highlights
    </h1>
    <pre>

Gaming highlights refer to moments during a game that are exceptional, exciting, or memorable. These can include impressive kills, 
clever strategies, funny interactions, or unexpected outcomes. Highlights are often captured and shared with others, especially in 
competitive gaming, as they showcase a player's skill, creativity, or humor.

Tips for Creating Great Gaming Highlights:

1. Focus on Unique Moments: Capture moments that stand out, like an impressive headshot, a clutch play, or a funny glitch.

2. Use Replay or Recording Tools: Many games offer replay modes or built-in recording functions to help you capture highlights.
